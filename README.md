# Melos Sidebar

VSCode extension for managing [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/) monorepos.

## Features

- **Sidebar Explorer**: View all your `melos.yaml` scripts in a dedicated sidebar.
- **One-Click Run**: Execute scripts directly from the sidebar.
- **Lifecycle Commands**: Quickly access `bootstrap` and `clean` commands.

## Requirements

- This extension expects `melos.yaml` to be present in your workspace root.
- You must have `melos` installed globally or available in your path (though the extension runs `melos` commmands, so it assumes the CLI is available).

## Extension Settings

This extension currently does not include any configurable settings.

## Known Issues

- None so far.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.1

- Initial release.
